### Bismuth

This model is intended to capture the appearance and textures of the bismuth gemstone. Most of the geometry began with stepwise polylines that I mirrored, extruded, duplicated, and otherwise arrayed. Marble and fresnel materials were used to create the texture, with RGB values taken directly from photos of bismuth to accurately construct the color gradients.

### Ovoid 

Taking heavy inspiration from the co-op characters featured in Portal 2, this model depicts an android character I sketched. Importing the cross-sectional drawings into Rhino made it especially fun to model each component with more accuracy, starting with basic solids that I oriented and transformed, before mirroring most components to the opposite side. The portal gun, companion cube, and surface models were made by wrapping decals to much simpler models I created.

### Wayfinder 

This composition includes many smaller objects that I modeled as part of a still life scene, to reimagine the visual style of a traditional Vanitas painting. Most models display borrowed assets attached as decals, to communicate the importance of exploring our interests and aspirations during our short lives. The placement of the objects are intended to lead the viewer's gaze out and across the horizon.
